#version 0.04-15 30.09.2014
-fixed a bug in basic.stats, when only one population with index 2, caused a non conformable array error message. 
Now add 1 to the last element of the population vector

#version 0.04-14 25.09.2014
-Modified sim.genot to allow for different island sizes and independant inbreeding coefficient

#version 0.04-11 31.10.2013
-fixed a bug in boot.ppfst which stop the looping over populations to be carried out correctly
-basic.stats can now take input from data set made of one sample only (a dummy extra line is added to the data set)

#version 0.04-10 09.04.2013

cleaned up things to avoid warning messages
#version 0.04-5 30.07.2010
changed \format to \value in Rd file
#version 0.04-4 15.08.2006
removed data frame names (names.data<-names(data)) in prepdata, caused a bug from R version 2.3.1 when only one level and does not seem to do anything


#version 0.04-3 30.06.2006
fixed a bug in boot.vc, now the function removes monomorphic loci before carrying out the bootstrap, and gives an error message if the number of polymorphic loci is less than 5

#version 0.04-2

fixed a bug in genot2al when alleles were coded with 3 digits but with number not exceeding 9

#version 0.04-1

boot.vc now provides bootstrap CI for variance components.

#version 0.03-4

fixed bug in samp.within, now it can handle lev with only one subgroup

#version 0.03-3

Again fixed bugs in test.between, test.between.within and test.within. replaced as.integer(x) with as.integer(factor(x)) forcing consecutive numbering of factor levels. 

#version 0.03-2
Again fixed bugs in test.between, test.between.within and test.within. No renumbering of factor levels, factors are just forced as integers and sorted once.

updated some references

#version 0.03-1
in varcomp.glob, added diploid as a parameter passed to varcomp. Absence of this option caused the function to report an error message when the data were haploid
Changes were made to functions test.between, test.between.within and test.within. The vector rand.unit and test.lev are transformed such that the different units are numbered consecutively
Updated the reference list

#version 0.02.2
in samp.between and samp.within, changed x<-NULL (which caused message Error: more elements supplied than there are to replace) into x<-list().  

#version 0.02

The function test.between, test.between.within and test.within now sort the data before doing the resampling. This avoids errors when the vector within, rand.unit and test.lev are not sorted. 

In function test.between and test.between.within, the vector rand.unit is transformed such that the different units are numbered consecutively
